          <p class="text-gray">I had the opportunity to visit America, the land of freedom. I was thrilled when I overheard my mother talking to my friend‚Äôs father; Tom‚Äôs father on the phone for me to join my Toms family in their holiday to America. I could not sleep that night.</p>
          <ul class="text-gray">
            <li> I would be going to Florida for two weeks, and that I would accompany my friend‚Äôs family. I could not have asked for a better morning in Britain. The sun was shining and so was I.</li>
            <li>The city was beautiful, a lot better than I ever imagined. I was looking forward to arrive to the hotel and dive in the swimming pool. Everything was so organized and so calm; the palm trees, the hot weather, the tourists and the locals blending together perfectly. This is America!</li>
            <li>   Arriving at the hotel, the first impression was excellent. The entrance was through two big metal doors along a very tall wall surrounding the huge garden and the hotel buildings.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray">In conclusion, I had a very good trip with no incidents, all the flight attendants were so nice and polite, the food was good and I had a great time; I could say that I enjoyed my trip to America.
